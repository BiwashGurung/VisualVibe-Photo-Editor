# Photo-Editor-Tool

VisualVibe is a simple yet versatile photo editing tool, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at providing an intuitive editing experience for users. The tool boasts four essential filters—Brightness, Saturation, Inversion, and Grayscale—to enhance images and bring out their best qualities. Users can effortlessly upload their desired image by clicking on the "Choose" button, allowing them to start editing right away. The filter adjustment bar lets users easily tweak the intensity of each filter to achieve the desired effect, whether it's brightening up colors, saturating the image, creating unique visual effects, or converting it to grayscale for a classic touch. If users decide to start over or try different editing options, the "Reset Filter" function undoes all applied changes, providing a clean canvas for experimentation. Once users are satisfied with the result, the "Save Image" button comes to the rescue, enabling them to download and save the edited photo directly to their local disk, ready for sharing or further use. VisualVibe's user-friendly interface and essential editing tools make it a perfect choice for anyone seeking a straightforward and effective photo editing experience.
